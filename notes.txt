Wed 5/12
got brief and started planning 5/12
thought about models, got sign-off (and clarification on some concepts)
looked at a few design examples
wireframes
model & views planning
started code added, file structure made and first packages installed

Thu 6/12
models with basic fields in
band routes
user routes
message routes (was deleting a different message than the ID I passed in. After a google it turns out I was using Matt's "findOneAndDelete/Remove" method instead of "findByIdAndDelete", which now definitely works as should)
auth routes (register and login)
started testing (copied index_spec from desserts)
no idea how to add the instruments: - The ones from seeds are not showing up in insomnia even though I'm populating them. - referenced schema doesn't work at all: don't know how to add them to seeds so they reflect the model => there was a fucking typo in the seed data (instument), that's why seeds weren't showing in insomnia. Still wonder if enums would be easier, but don't know if I can add to them
realised I don't need a create route for users, duh!
realised I don't have a different way to register as a user OR a band. Think I'll just make creating a band a secure route and people will have to manage their band... ? (maybe talk to Sophia/Joe)

Fri 7/12
rejigged bands, users and instruments again, not sure if correctly (need conceptual help)
set up app.js, started home and header
brainsweeping sesh with Rob: turns out I need to have instruments as a separate entity AND another two routes to add and delete from user's instruments Played array
started register on frontend, but doesn't work (can't read state of undefined)
did a bit more testing (show and create on bands; show doesn't return 200 response, even though it does in insomnia)
added secure route to routes
faffed
